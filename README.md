# fairness_loss_and_measurement
Scarce medical resources and highly transmissible disease may overwhelm health care infrastructure. Fair allocation based on disease progression and fair distribution among all
demographic groups is demanding for the society. Surprisingly, there is little work quantifying and ensuring fairness in the context of dynamic survival prediction to equally allocate medical
resource. In this study, we quantify individual and group fairness metrics to evaluate dynamic survival model with time dependent covariates, and we further develop a fair dynamic survival model that can incorporate the fairness constraints to optimize the
dynamic survival prediction for longitudinal electronic health records. To demonstrate the impact of fairness constraints, we compare the modelâ€™s performance with that of individual
constraints and group constraints. Our experiments on the real world dataset demonstrate that our Fair-DSP can guarantee fairness in dynamic survival analysis in the presence of accurate prediction.
